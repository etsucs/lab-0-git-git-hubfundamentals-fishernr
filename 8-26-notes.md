8/26, day 2 notes Nicholas fisher
•	First job won’t be c sharp or java 
•	Learn how to learn
•	Anything with code turn in with git hub
•	Git hub streamlines working in a team

•	Vcs – version control system
•	Manage files and directories 

•	Git created by Linus Torvalds April 2005
•	Git distributed version control (DVC)
•	Works without central server or internet
•	Work independently merge code later

•	Repository can contain anything for the project in person
•	Coding should be done incrementally 

•	Use branching to experiment without harming the project if it goes wrong
•	Main is baseline so branch form here
•	Commits – any changes to a branch
•	Pull request – initiates discussion about your commits

•	I’m already used to visual studio so I won’t write much on it
